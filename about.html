        <div class="prose_text">

            <p> Photography is a pervasive influence on how I see the world. The poet William Stafford described meeting one's muse as discovering "your own way of looking at things", and how "<a href="http://phys.unm.edu/~tw/fas/yits/archive/stafford_whenimetmymuse.html">every glance at the world around you will be a sort of salvation</a>"; I relate to this metaphor often. Photography adds its own layer of meaning to my experiences, and I am glad to share it. </p>

            <p> Travel has influenced my subjects and style. A winter in Australia, a summer in Singapore, a year in <a href="https://flic.kr/p/wKsPdR">Scotland</a>, three extended visits to <a href="https://flic.kr/p/QZVYsQ">India</a>, and trips to 30-some other countries all contributed to my development as a photographer. Travel is a powerful conduit for photography's strengths as an art: travel photography allows us to share things like the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/xGXhP4">uniqueness</a> of times and places, the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/WJ3abj">emotional impact</a> of significant events, the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/PWLkbw">mixture</a> of familiar and faraway, and the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/J5KTpX">excitement</a> of exploration. Travel is also a privilege, and photography can spread its positive influence to a wider audience. </p>

            <p> Textures inspire me: <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ReaPzg">lichen</a>, <a href="https://flic.kr/p/DtG5VB">peeling paint</a>, <a href="https://flic.kr/p/FLMeU2">a pile of leaves</a>, <a href="https://flic.kr/p/z6kQfG">stone contoured by water</a>, <a href="https://flic.kr/p/yg7RSS">flower petals</a>, and <a href="https://flic.kr/p/UiJSwK">cut stone</a> are some examples. I often collect a texture without specific plans for it, later finding another photograph in my collection to merge it with. Textures can intensify our perception of color, drawing attention to the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/y75ruF">blueness</a> of the sky or the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/G6PhhE">redness</a> of leaves on a tree. I sometimes use the colors in a photograph of texture to add surreal elements to a picture, such as <a href="https://flic.kr/p/GBbQEq">shimmering in a sunset</a> or <a href="https://flic.kr/p/QDBwiU">turbulence in a night sky</a>. </p>

            <p> Although I shoot in color, I sometimes edit and produce photographs in monochrome. The removal of color affects composition and it can draw attention to the presence of the intended subject, or to a notable absence. Monochrome has cultural connotations, including <a href="https://flic.kr/p/22Hb2PN">intimacy</a>, <a href="https://flic.kr/p/KL7viL">struggle</a>, <a href="https://flic.kr/p/xRP7if">drama</a>, <a href="https://flic.kr/p/21FTSJa">historicity</a>, and <a href="https://flic.kr/p/xGkeUx">noir</a>. It sometimes intensifies <a href="https://flic.kr/p/CZt17b">shapes</a> and <a href="https://flic.kr/p/25vxFp9">textures</a>. I also occasionally use split toning to <a href="https://flic.kr/p/UiJQAF">convey a mood</a> or to <a href="https://flic.kr/p/WYZoJF">control the composition</a> without entirely ceding color. </p>

<p> I maintain a separate online collection of photography of political protests, and I have two goals (at least) with this collection. The first is to capture the passion, enthusiasm, and vitality on display at these events. My photography style for protests draws inspiration from street photography: rather than asking people to pose with their signs, I search for candid compositions when people express themselves naturally. My second aim is to document history and, as part of that, show a wider audience&mdash;beyond those who attend protests&mdash;what these events are like. </p>

            <p> Technically challenging photography also motivates me. <a href="https://flic.kr/p/Er7eZx">Nighttime photography</a>, <a href="https://flic.kr/p/wKjfoE">macro photography</a>, and <a href="https://flic.kr/p/xUmcMY">unusual compositions</a> are some examples of this. I enjoy finding ways to maximize technical quality and aesthetic value in spite of obstacles. </p>

            <p> I use a DSLR for photography. I shoot using a collection of roughly a dozen lenses, though I generally carry just two or three for any project or expedition. I value mobility in my photographic style: I carry my equipment in a dedicated bag (generally a backpack or a sling) that lets me walk long distances and pull out my camera and lenses quickly <a href="https://flic.kr/p/T2n5vS">without putting anything down</a>. Rather than using a shoulder strap, I use a hand strap that lets me retrieve and stow the camera frequently or keep it in my hand for extended periods of time. I use a tripod only when necessary for long exposures or interval sequences. I use UV filters to protect my lenses, but I rarely use other filters, as I prefer to add effects in postprocessing. </p>

<p> I shoot in RAW, and my editing style is pragmatic: some photographs are ready to share with little to no editing, while some require substantial work to bring out their worth. I find value in understanding all the choices that affect the production of a photograph, including choices in camera gear, shooting parameters, and editing. Artifacts of choice are pervasive in photographs: vignetting, sharpness, contrast, saturation, grain, aspect ratio, and other properties of an image come from deliberate decisions or happenstance. Consciously making decisions increases the likelihood of success for every shot, and it gives the photographer the greatest flexibility for the images they produce. </p>

            <p>Finally, the extent to which I have pursued photography is a privilege. It is a skill that I developed over decades of exceptional (often lucky) opportunities and tens of thousands of shutter presses. I never planned to "get into photography"; if anything, my plan was to write as a creative outlet, but photography gradually filled that role instead. Although my career in academia limits my free time, it continues to make all of this possible.</p>
